# XRP Web Application Repository

This repository contains the XRP Web application source code using React + TypeScript + Vite with a Python FastAPI backend. The XRP is an open-robotics platform designed to help you take your first steps into engineering, robotics, and software development.

The XRP software platform is an integrated development environment where you can develop your robotics software program using either the visual block programming paradigm or the Python language.

## Team 5962: Girls in STEAM

This is Team 5962's copy of XRPWeb. We added a kids mode with just a few big blocks so we can use it at outreach events.

The app is live here, and there's nothing to install: https://eeveemara.github.io/xrp-web/

These are also in the site's top menu, under **GiS Docs**.

### Changing the app

Skip this unless you're editing the code. You need Node 20 or newer.

```bash
npm ci
npm run stage:firmware -- v2.0.7
npm run dev
```

The team colors are in `src/team-theme.css` and the 2 color lists at the top of `tailwind.config.js`.

Run `npm run lint`, `npm test -- --run` and `npm run build` before you push. Whatever lands on `main` is live on the site a few minutes later, so check the Actions tab and make sure it went green.

Everything below here is from the original XRPWeb project. If it says something different from this section, go with this section.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher) 
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Development Environment Setup

- Install VSCode or Google Antigravity
- Install IDE Extensions
    - Pylance
    - Python
    - ESLint
    - Prettier
    - Git Graph
    - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Install NodeJS
- Install Python
- Setup Python Virtual Environment

#### Debugging

- Create a launch.json file in the .vscode directory to debug the frontend
```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "XRP Web",
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000",
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd XRPWeb
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create the environment file**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CHATAPI_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:8000
   GOOGLE_AUTH_URL=
   ```

   - `GOOGLE_CHATAPI_PROXY_TARGET` — URL of the AI chat API backend (proxied under `/api`)
   - `GOOGLE_AUTH_URL` — Base URL of the Google Auth backend (used to fetch the OAuth client ID)

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Backend Setup (AI Assistant)

The backend provides the XRPCode Buddy AI assistant functionality through a secure FastAPI proxy.

1. **Navigate to backend directory**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create Python virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   # backend/.env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

   Get your free Gemini API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

5. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Running Both Services

For full functionality, run both frontend and backend:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Backend  
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
python main.py
```

## 🤖 XRPCode Buddy - AI Assistant

- **📚 Complete XRP Documentation** - All API references, tutorials, and programming guides
- **💻 Your Current Code** - Both Python files and Blockly visual programs you have open
- **🎯 Context-Aware Responses** - Answers based on official XRP documentation and your specific code

### Key Features

- **Instant Code Help**: Get explanations and debugging assistance for your current code
- **Documentation-Backed Answers**: All responses reference official XRP robotics documentation

- **Security**: API keys stored server-side, not exposed to browser
- **Context Management**: Automatic file content inclusion and XRP documentation integration 


## Team 5962 Kids Robotics Mode

This fork includes a simplified Blockly mode for FRC Team 5962 outreach events. When
`XRP_KIDS_MODE` is enabled, younger students see only the high-level movement,
loop, and basic control blocks needed for the activity.

See:

- `docs/KIDS_ROBOTICS_EVENT.md`
- `docs/KIDS_ROBOTICS_STUDENT_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/KIDS_ROBOTICS_CHALLENGES.md`

The four custom movement blocks delegate directly to XRPLib's
`DifferentialDrive.straight()` and `DifferentialDrive.turn()` methods. No custom
encoder or gyro control algorithm is added.
